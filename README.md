INTRODUCTION
============

TypeCalc is a calculator made for the Pok√©mon games (all generations except RBY) used to generate a report of how many weaknesses your team have, based on the traditional type chart.

The code uses strict mode and is tested with JsTestDriver. I intent to document it with JSDoc 3 in the future. I'm trying to tidy up the code as much as possible, as a means to improve my JavaScript skills. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

USE
===

This software is made with JavaScript and can be used from any browser that supports it. Also, you can use this calculator or parts of it in your own projects, according to the chosen license (MIT License). Ah, you need [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

If you have any issues or troubles, please use the ['Issues'](https://github.com/mojambo/typecalc/issues) functionality from Github. I'll be glad to help, be it a feature requests or a bug report. If you know PT-BR, please contribute posting to our forum "[Reportar falha](http://mojambo.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=16&sid=5a4ab1bcd3fc399efb6af9c249519503)".
